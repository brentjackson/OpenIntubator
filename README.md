# OpenIntubator
A shortage of intubation devices is a critical concern for the COVID-19 pandemic. The purpose of this open source hardware project is to develop designs whereby makers can assist with the fabrication of intubation devices that could be used by medical personnel.

The initiator of this project has no specific expertise in this area. We are calling on everyone to join and contribute in this hour of need.
